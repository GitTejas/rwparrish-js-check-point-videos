/*
Declare a variable called pizza and assign it a string value of a pizza type of your choosing e.g., "cheese" - although it should probably be "peperoni".

Next, declare a function called checkNumber that takes a number as an argument and returns the string "positive" if the argument is greater than 0 and "negative" if the argument is less than 0.

Then test the function to be sure that it works.

Lastly, explain the scope of your function parameter and the pizza variable.
