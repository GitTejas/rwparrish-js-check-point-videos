# Check Point Video

## Introduction

Albert Einstein once said, "The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know," reflecting the idea that learning unveils deeper questions and reveals the vastness of knowledge. As you progress through this program, you might resonate with this sentiment, and that's a positive sign. Learning programming, while very rewarding, is challenging, and knowing when you've grasped a concept well enough to move forward can be tricky.

To assist you in this journey, we offer the opportunity to create a "Check Point" video. You'll record yourself working and talking through a random challenge. You've likely heard of ["rubber ducking"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) by now. Talking about code, such as in a video recording, can help uncover gaps in comprehension and reinforce your use of terminology. These videos are meant to help you assess your understanding of key programming concepts and provide an avenue for instructor feedback. 

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this lesson.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser. You should see a spinner.
3. Open Zoom, share your screen, and find the record button.
3. Before spinning the wheel to find out which challenge you'll record yourself working and talking through, consider creating a couple 10-second videos to ensure your setup records both your screen and your voice effectively. For an example, refer to this [link].
3. When you are comfortable with recording using Zoom, start your recording and and spin the wheel!
4. cd into the directory with the name corresponding to challenge the wheel lands on and open the script.js file.
5. The `script.js` file contains the challenge so you are now ready to go! The video should be **5 minutes or less**.
6. When you are finished, you can upload your video to YouTube and submit the link to it.

# Tips to get the most out of this exercise
1. Try not to overthink it! Just do your best. It's OK to not know what you don't yet know!
2. Try to use the correct terminologies as you talk through the code and answer the question(s) in the challenge.
3. Have fun!
