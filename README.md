Intro

Albert Einstein said, “The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know”. This quote reflects a sentiment of humility and intellectual growth. It means that as you learn more, you ask more detailed questions, and realize that there is more to know than time to learn it. As you work your way through the program you may find that you can identify with this quote - and that is a GOOD thing. After all, Albert Einstein said it. Programming is hard but rewarding and when learning something new, especially something as vast and challenging as programming, it can be difficult to gauge when you know “enough” about a particular concept before moving to the next. 

To help alleviate this, you have the opportunity to create a “Check Point” video. The videos are meant to help you gauge your comprehension of key programming concepts and give you the chance to get some feedback from your instructor. You’ve probably heard the term “rubber ducking” by now. Forcing yourself to talk about code out loud, e.g, for a video recording, will help you confront gaps in your understanding and give you practice using all the new terms you’ve been learning. With that in mind, in order to get the most out of this exercise you should do your best to use accurate terminologies when talking about the code.

Code Challenge 

Fork and clone this lesson. Open the index.html file in your browser and use the spinner to find out which code challenge you will take on! Be sure to cd into the corresponding directory before you begin the problem. You can use Zoom to start a meeting and record yourself while screensharing. Take a look at this (link) video for an example of how to get all set up. You may want to create one or two 10 second videos before you start the problem so you can be sure you are recording your screen and your voice can be heard in the recording.
